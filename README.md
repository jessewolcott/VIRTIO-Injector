# VirtIO Driver Injector

A PowerShell script that automatically injects VirtIO drivers into Windows disk images (WIM, VHD, VHDX) for virtualization environments like QEMU/KVM, Proxmox, and oVirt.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multi-format Support**: Works with WIM, VHD, and VHDX disk images
- **Automatic Driver Download**: Downloads the latest VirtIO drivers automatically
- **Smart Driver Installation**: Uses appropriate DISM methods for each image type
- **Flexible Commit Options**: Choose to commit, discard, or prompt for changes
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Robust cleanup and error recovery
- **Detailed Logging**: Full transcript logging of all operations
- **Unsigned Driver Support**: Optional installation of unsigned drivers

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** or **Windows Server 2016+**
- **PowerShell 5.1** (because of DISM)
- **Administrator privileges** (required for DISM operations)
- **Windows ADK Deployment Tools** (auto-installed if missing for WIM files)
- **Internet connection** (for driver download if not provided locally)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Download the `Inject-VirtioDrivers.ps1` script
2. Place it in your desired directory
3. Run PowerShell as Administrator
4. Execute the script with your parameters

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Usage

#### Simple execution - will prompt for commit decision
```powershell
.\Inject-VirtioDrivers.ps1 SourceDisk "C:\Images\Windows.vhd"
```
### Advanced Usage

#### Auto-commit with unsigned drivers
```powershell
Start-DismDriverAddition -SourceDisk "C:\Images\Windows.vhd" -ForceUnsigned $true -Commit $true
```
#### Use local VirtIO ISO
```powershell
Start-DismDriverAddition -SourceDisk "C:\Images\Windows.wim" -LocalIsoPath "C:\ISOs\virtio-win.iso"
```

#### Auto-discard changes (testing mode)
```powershell
Start-DismDriverAddition -SourceDisk "C:\Images\Windows.vhdx" -Commit $false
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `SourceDisk` | String | **Required** | Path to the disk image (WIM/VHD/VHDX) |
| `ForceUnsigned` | Boolean | `$false` | Install unsigned drivers (needed for older Windows versions) |
| `LocalIsoPath` | String | `""` | Path to local VirtIO ISO (downloads if empty) |
| `Commit` | Boolean | `$null` | Auto-commit (`$true`), auto-discard (`$false`), or prompt (`$null`) |

## üéØ What It Does

1. **Mounts your disk image** using the appropriate method:
   - **WIM files**: Uses `Mount-WindowsImage` PowerShell cmdlet
   - **VHD/VHDX files**: Uses `Mount-DiskImage` and assigns drive letters

2. **Downloads VirtIO drivers** (if not provided locally):
   - Downloads from official Fedora VirtIO repository
   - Caches locally for future use
   - Supports custom local ISO files

3. **Installs drivers** using optimal method:
   - **WIM images**: `Add-WindowsDriver` PowerShell cmdlet
   - **VHD/VHDX images**: `dism.exe` with `/Image:` parameter

4. **Handles results intelligently**:
   - ‚úÖ **Exit Code 0**: All drivers installed successfully
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Exit Code 50**: Partial success (unsigned drivers skipped - normal behavior)
   - ‚ùå **Other codes**: Actual errors requiring attention

## üìä Driver Installation Results

Based on testing with Windows 10/11 images:

- **‚úÖ Successfully Installed**: ~270 drivers (84% success rate)
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Skipped (Unsigned)**: ~50 drivers (older Windows versions: 2k12, 2k12R2, w8, w8.1)
- **üéØ Critical Drivers**: All essential drivers installed (storage, network, display)

### Key Drivers Installed
- **Storage**: `vioscsi`, `viostor` (boot-critical)
- **Network**: `NetKVM` (network connectivity)
- **Display**: `qxl`, `qxldod` (graphics)
- **Input**: `vioinput` (mouse/keyboard)
- **Memory**: `balloon`, `viomem` (memory management)
- **Serial**: `vioserial` (console access)

## üîß Configuration

Edit the script variables at the bottom:

```powershell
# Configuration
$SourceDisk = "Z:\YourImage.vhd"     # Path to your disk image
$ForceUnsigned = $false              # Set to $true for unsigned drivers
$LocalIsoPath = ""                   # Path to local ISO or empty for download
$Commit = $true                      # Auto-commit, auto-discard, or prompt
```
## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"The parameter is incorrect" errors**
- Ensure you're running as Administrator
- Verify the image file exists and isn't corrupted
- Check that the image contains a valid Windows installation

**Exit Code 50 (Partial Success) - This is Normal!**
- ‚úÖ **This is expected behavior** when `ForceUnsigned=$false`
- üéØ **270 out of 320 drivers installed successfully** (84% success rate)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **50 unsigned drivers were skipped** - these are primarily for older Windows versions (2k12, 2k12R2, w8, w8.1)
- üîë **All critical drivers were installed**: storage (vioscsi, viostor), network (NetKVM), display (qxl, qxldod)
- üí° **Use `-ForceUnsigned $true`** only if you specifically need the older/unsigned drivers

**"WIMMount service is missing"**
- Script will auto-install Windows ADK Deployment Tools
- Requires internet connection and Administrator privileges

**"Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Path' because it is an empty string"**
- This occurs when `$PSScriptRoot` is empty (running from console vs saved script)
- Script automatically falls back to `$env:TEMP` directory
- Ensure you have write permissions to the temp directory

**VHD/VHDX mounting issues**
- Verify the VHD/VHDX file isn't corrupted
- Ensure sufficient disk space for temporary copy
- Check that no other process is using the file

**ISO download failures**
- Check internet connectivity
- Verify firewall isn't blocking the download
- Try providing a local ISO path with `-LocalIsoPath` parameter

### Understanding Exit Codes

| Exit Code | Meaning | Action Required |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| **0** | ‚úÖ Complete success - all drivers installed | None - perfect result |
| **50** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial success - unsigned drivers skipped | **Normal behavior** - critical drivers installed |
| **Other** | ‚ùå Actual error occurred | Check DISM logs and error messages |

### Log Files

The script creates detailed logs for troubleshooting:
- **Transcript**: `DISM_Driver_Add_Transcript_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`
- **DISM Log**: `C:\Windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log`
- **Temp files**: Automatically cleaned up after execution

### Performance Tips

**Speed up execution:**
- Use local VirtIO ISO instead of downloading: `-LocalIsoPath "C:\path\to\virtio-win.iso"`
- Run on SSD storage for faster VHD/VHDX operations
- Ensure adequate RAM (8GB+ recommended for large images)

**Reduce disk usage:**
- VHD/VHDX operations create temporary copies - ensure 2x image size free space
- Temp files are automatically cleaned up on completion

### Advanced Troubleshooting

**Enable verbose DISM logging:**
```powershell
# Add to DISM arguments for more detailed logging
$dismArgs += "/LogLevel:4"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Always test with non-production images first. This script modifies disk images and should be used with caution in production environments.

**‚úÖ Success Indicator**: Exit code 50 with 270+ drivers installed is considered successful for most use cases. The unsigned driver warnings are expected and normal behavior.

**üîß Pro Tip**: For production deployments, consider using `-ForceUnsigned $false` (default) to maintain security best practices, as all critical drivers will still be installed successfully.
